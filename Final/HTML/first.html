<h1>Fundamentals of HTML</h1>
<h2>Text Formatting</h2>
<p>A paragraph with <em>some words that are emphasized</em> and <b>some important words. </b> Followed by some <mark>highlighted words.</mark> Feel free to add any other text formatting that appeals to you.</p>
<pre>
    This is some text
    that is laid out exactly as 
    Laid out at code level without any additional
    markup
</pre>
<h2>Special Characters</h2>
<p>The browser thinks &lt;  is a programming character. Also &gt;. The browser also ignores any line breaks<br>in your code and any&emsp;&emsp;white space. To include these you need to use special characters aka html character entities. There are other entites available such as &pound; and &amp;</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>A web page without any links is a unique and peculiar find. You can have links to separate sites such as <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk">Leeds Beckett</a>. Links to other pages of the <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/student-experience/accommodation/">same site.</a> Links to another point in the <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk#fb-root">same page.</a></p>
<h2>Images</h2>
<img src="spikachu.png" alt="image placeholder" style="width: 100px;height:100px;">

<p>This image is stored on this server in an image sub-folder</p>
<p>I hope you added an alt attribute to support screen readers</p>
<p>Why not check to see what happens if you try to validate your code using the W3C Markup Validation Service without the alt attribute included. If you right click on your page and chose inspect ot view source code you can check your code and see the HTML comment you have added just inside the body tag</p><hr>
